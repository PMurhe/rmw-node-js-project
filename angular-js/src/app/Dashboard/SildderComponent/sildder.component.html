    <p>An essay is, generally, a piece of writing that gives the author's own argument â€” but the definition is vague, overlapping
        with those of a paper, an article, a pamphlet, and a short story. Essays have traditionally been sub-classified as
        formal and informal. Formal essays are characterized by "serious purpose, dignity, logical organization, length,"
        whereas the informal essay is characterized by "the personal element (self-revelation, individual tastes and experiences,
        confidential manner), humor, graceful style, rambling structure, unconventionality or novelty of theme," etc.[1]
        Essays are commonly used as literary criticism, political manifestos, learned arguments, observations of daily life,
        recollections, and reflections of the author. Almost all modern essays are written in prose, but works in verse have
        been dubbed essays.</p>
